# scientific_computing_projects
The projects that I created for Brown University's CS4: Introduction to Scientific Computing and Problem Solving course. If you are a professor interested in teaching a similar course at your University, email me and I can send you sample solution files.

At Brown, these projects were accompanied by an open ended final project, challenging weekly homeworks and 2 exams.
